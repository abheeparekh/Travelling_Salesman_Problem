# Travelling_Salesman_Problem
The Travelling Salesman Problem, an NP hard problem, is solved with the Genetic Algorithm approach in Matlab.

Problem Statement: To find the shortest possible route for n cities with the condition of visiting only once and arriving at the starting city at the end. The time complexity of the problem is O(n!). Thus, heuristics approach is used to solve the problem.
